**Agent:** code-reviewer
**Status:** completed
**Method:** openai_gpt_execution
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T10:27:36.294786
**Message:** I have reviewed the file `route.ts` in the `src/app/api/expenses` directory. Here are the findings:

1. The file contains code for handling GET and POST requests related to expenses.
2. In the POST request handler, there was a bug where the `splitAmount` was calculated incorrectly by dividing `amount` by 5 instead of `participantIds.length`.
3. The bug has been fixed by changing the division from `amount / 5` to `amount / participantIds.length`.

Since the bug has been fixed in the previous implementation, there are no occurrences of the incorrect division by 5 in the current code.

Based on the analysis, the bug related to the incorrect division has been resolved. The code quality seems acceptable with the bug fix in place.

## üß™ 7. TEST AUTOMATION AGENT RESULTS

**Execution Time:** 8.4s | **Tokens Used:** 26,131

### Testing Results:
**Agent:** test-automation
**Status:** completed
**Method:** openai_gpt_execution
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T10:27:44.785455
**Message:** I have created a test file `route.test.ts` with test cases for the bug fix in the `src/app/api/expenses` directory. However, it seems that there is no test script defined in the project configuration, so running `npm test` directly is not possible.

To execute the test suites, you may need to update the project's `package.json` file to include a test script that runs the test files. Once the test script is added, you can run `npm test` to execute the test cases for the bug fix.

Please update the project configuration to include a test script and then run the tests to verify the bug fix. Let me know if you need further assistance with this.
