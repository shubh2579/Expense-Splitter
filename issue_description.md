### Code Review Results:
**Agent:** code-reviewer
**Status:** completed
**Method:** openai_gpt_execution
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-29T17:04:34.073270
**Message:** I have reviewed the code in the `route.ts` file of the Expense-Splitter project. 

### Code Analysis:
- The code contains a bug where the calculation for splitAmount always divides by 5 instead of `participantIds.length`.
- This bug is identified by the comment: `BUG: Always divides by 5 instead of participantIds.length`.

### Recommendations:
- **Bug Fix**: Update the calculation for `splitAmount` to correctly divide by `participantIds.length` instead of a fixed number like 5.
- **Code Quality**: Consider refactoring the error handling and validation logic for better readability and maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Add comments or documentation to explain the purpose of functions and the data flow.
