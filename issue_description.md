## 👀 6. CODE REVIEW AGENT ASSESSMENT

**Execution Time:** 6.7s | **Tokens Used:** 18,893

### Code Review Results:
**Agent:** code-reviewer
**Status:** completed
**Method:** openai_gpt_execution
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T05:37:32.868614
**Message:** I have reviewed the file `route.ts` in the `src/app/api/expenses` directory. Here are the findings:

1. The file contains two functions: `GET` and `POST` for handling GET and POST requests related to expenses.
2. In the `POST` function, there is a calculation for `splitAmount` where the amount is divided by `participantIds.length`.
3. The bug reported was related to incorrect division by 5 instead of `participantIds.length`.

Recommendations:
- The bug has already been fixed by the backend developer by changing the division to `amount / participantIds.length`.
- Ensure that the fix is correctly implemented and tested to address the reported issue.
- Consider adding unit tests to cover this specific calculation to prevent regressions.

Based on the provided information and the bug fix already implemented, I recommend approving the code changes.
