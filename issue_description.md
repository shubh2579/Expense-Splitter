## 👀 6. CODE REVIEW AGENT ASSESSMENT

**Execution Time:** 8.8s | **Tokens Used:** 19,358

### Code Review Results:
**Agent:** code-reviewer
**Status:** completed
**Method:** openai_gpt_execution
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T05:07:02.419506
**Message:** I have reviewed the `route.ts` file where the bug was reported. Here is a summary of the findings:

- The file contains two main functions: `GET()` and `POST(request: NextRequest)`.
- In the `POST` function, there is a calculation for `splitAmount` where the amount is divided by `participantIds.length`. However, there is a bug where it always divides by 5 instead of `participantIds.length`.

### Recommendations:
1. **Bug Fix**: Update the calculation for `splitAmount` to correctly divide by `participantIds.length` instead of a hardcoded value of 5.
2. **Code Quality**: Consider adding comments or documentation to explain the calculation logic for future reference.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling mechanisms are in place for different scenarios in the code.

Based on the review, I recommend addressing the bug fix and improving the code quality for better maintainability.

### Review Results:
